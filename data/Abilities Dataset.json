Moves that switch the target out and moves that switch the user out strike twice, then force a Pok\u00e9mon to switch out after both strikes are conducted. Thief, Covet, Bug Bite, and Pluck do not steal or eat the target's held item until after the final strike, so if the target could use its item after the first strike (e.g. due to low HP), it will use it before the attacker can steal or eat it. Smelling Salts, Wake-Up Slap, and Knock Off do not cure the target's status condition or remove its held item (respectively) until after the final strike, so both strikes get the increased power. Fire-type moves, Scald, and Steam Eruption thaw a frozen target after the final strike (so a frozen target cannot be thawed and then burned by the same move). Smack Down and Thousand Arrows only cause the target to fall to the ground after the final strike. If Meloetta has Parental Bond and uses Relic Song, it will change Forme only once, after the final strike.

Fixed-damage moves (such as Seismic Toss and Dragon Rage) deal the full amount of damage for both strikes. The damage dealt by Psywave is generated separately for each strike, and the second strike's damage is not halved. Each strike of Super Fang halves the target's HP (effectively quartering it if HP is not changed between strikes). Counter, Mirror Coat, Metal Burst, and Bide deal the full amount of damage for both strikes. The first strike of Assurance counts as previously taking damage for the second strike, giving it increased power. Fury Cutter and Echoed Voice only consider uses of the move rather than hits, so the second strike's power is not boosted by the first strike. Grass Pledge, Fire Pledge, and Water Pledge strike twice, even when used as a combination move. Natural Gift and Spit Up strike twice.

Moves that have one of these properties in addition to an additional effect will be powered up and only the additional effect will be negated. For example, Flare Blitz inflicts recoil damage to the user, but also has an additional effect to burn; if the user has Sheer Force, Flare Blitz's damage will be boosted by 30% and the user will take recoil damage, but it cannot burn the target.

Other effects are not negated this way; therefore, if a Pok\u00e9mon with Sheer Force holding a Life Orb uses a move boosted by Sheer Force, it will gain the passive damage boost (because it isn't a secondary effect of the move nor is it on the list of skipped effects), but the Pok\u00e9mon will not be damaged by the Life Orb.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Sheer Force","Effect":"Sheer Force does not affect Max Moves, neither powering them up nor removing their secondary effects.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Shell Armor","Effect":"Shell Armor prevents Pok\u00e9mon from receiving a critical hit, even if they would usually always land one such as with Frost Breath, Storm Throw, Wicked Blow, Surging Strikes, or with Merciless (if the target is poisoned).","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Shield Dust","Effect":"Pok\u00e9mon with Shield Dust are unaffected by the additional effects of damaging moves, including additional effects provided by Poison Touch, Stench, or King's Rock.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Shield Dust","Effect":"For example, a Pok\u00e9mon with Shield Dust cannot be frozen by Blizzard or made to flinch by Fake Out.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Shield Dust","Effect":"Shield Dust has no effect on status moves, such as Thunder Wave or Leech Seed, or on moves that force the target to switch out, such as Dragon Tail.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Shield Dust","Effect":"Unlike Sheer Force, Shield Dust does not remove additional effects applied to the move's user, such as stat increases or HP draining.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Shields Down","Effect":"At the start of battle or at the end of a turn, if Minior's HP is above half, it will change into its Meteor Form.
