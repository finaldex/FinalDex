It then transports the player from their current location to the corresponding spot of the Underground's tunnels."},{"Effect":"The Explorer Kit includes all the basic tools used when adventuring, mining, and collecting in the Underground. When certain tools are used for the first time, notes describing their functionality are shown to the player."},{"Effect":"Hammer: The hammer is used to dig through walls to find spheres and treasures. It makes a bigger impact on the wall than the pickaxe, digging up several tiles at a time; however, this causes the wall to collapse at double the speed. The wall will collapse after 25 hammer hits."},{"Effect":"Pickaxe: The pickaxe is also used to dig through walls. It makes a smaller impact on the wall than the hammer, causing fewer tiles to be dug up at a time. This causes the wall to stay strong for longer before collapsing. If anyone else is mining nearby, a pickaxe will appear on the player's screen wherever the other player hits on their screen. The wall will collapse after 49 pickaxe hits."},{"Effect":"Map: The map is displayed on the top screen and shows all of the Underground as well as spots to dig into the walls. There are six independent sections of the labyrinth, each accessible from different places in Sinnoh. In terms of vendors and mining treasures, the areas are equivalent. When in multiplayer mode, the map also shows the positioning of the other players in the Underground."},{"Effect":"Radar: The radar locates all treasure, spheres, and traps in the Underground. By touching the touch screen, the radar will appear and locate all treasure, spheres, and traps near to the player. If a sparkle is revealed on the floor using the radar, it is either a trap or a sphere; traps have white sparkles, while spheres have gold. If both are hidden in one spot, a trap is found first, then a sphere. If the sparkle is in the wall, it is a bulging section that can be mined."},{"Effect":"The Explorer Kit also comes with containers to carry Spheres and Decorations (aka Goods). Spheres are the currency of the Underground. They can be sold to vendors that appear in the Underground. These explorers are stationary and will only rotate in place. Each of the three types accept spheres, and will trade the player either goods, traps, or treasures."},{"Effect":"Goods are generally known as the items that can be used in the Underground to decorate the player's Secret Base, such as dolls, chairs, and tables. Goods can also be purchased in the fourth floor of the Veilstone Department Store, or obtained from Mr. Goods after completing certain requirements. The rarity of the goods is determined by the value of the Sphere being asked for. For example, an Iron Beam is worth a Prism Sphere 9 and a Pink Dresser is worth a Green Sphere 54. This concludes that the Pink Dresser has a much higher rarity than the Iron Beam."}]},"0x01AD":{"Index":"0x01AD","Item":["Loot Sack"],"ID":429,"File":"Loot Sack","Pocket":"Unknown"},"0x01AE":{"Index":"0x01AE","Item":["Rule Book"],"ID":430,"File":"Rule Book","Pocket":"Unknown"},"0x01AF":{"Index":"0x01AF","Item":["Poké Radar"],"ID":431,"File":"Poké Radar","Pocket":"Unknown","Effect":[{"Effect":"The Poké Radar is obtained after receiving the National Pokédex."},{"Effect":"It can only be used in tall grass, while on foot. When used, a tune will begin to play, and up to four patches of grass will shake briefly. Upon entering one of these patches of grass, a battle with a wild Pokémon will begin immediately, even if the player is using a Repel. Depending on the game, different patches may shake in a different way, corresponding to rarer species of wild Pokémon. However, all games feature a very rare and distinct type of shaking grass that glows white twice; such a grass patch will always contain a Shiny Pokémon."},{"Effect":"Like the Vs. Seeker, the Radar's battery must be charged after use by walking around. It takes 50 steps to fully charge the Poké Radar."},{"Effect":"If the wild Pokémon is knocked out or captured in a Poké Ball, a chain will begin; this is the principle mechanic of the Poké Radar and crucial to increasing the probability of encountering a Shiny Pokémon. When a chain is in progress, the Poké Radar will automatically activate again at the end of the battle, causing up to four more grass patches to shake. Depending on various circumstances, one of these patches may be more likely to contain the same species of Pokémon as the one just encountered; defeating or catching such a Pokémon will continue to increase the chain by 1. If a wild Pokémon of a different species is encountered, or if a battle ends without defeating or capturing the wild Pokémon, or if a wild Pokémon is encountered outside of the Poké Radar, then the chain will break and the Poké Radar will need to recharge before being used again. A chain can also automatically break if the player uses the Bicycle or Roller Skates, if the player scrolls all shaking grass patches off-screen by moving too far away from them, a Pokèmon evolves, or an Egg hatches. It is also possible to enter the wrong patch and randomly encounter the same Pokémon as was being chained, but the chain will still break in this case."},{"Effect":"Activating the Poké Radar manually in the middle of a chain will not break the chain, and will simply generate up to four new patches of shaking grass, replacing the old ones. This action is known as \"resetting\" the Radar. It is commonly used when none of the four patches is deemed likely to continue the chain; this determination varies between games."},{"Effect":"As the chain length increases, the probability of finding a Shiny patch also increases, up to a certain maximum. After reaching this maximum, the player no longer needs to attempt to increase the chain, and can simply recharge and reset the Radar over and over until a Shiny patch appears."}]},"0x01B0":{"Index":"0x01B0","Item":["Point Card"],"ID":432,"File":"Point Card","Pocket":"Unknown"},"0x01B1":{"Index":"0x01B1","Item":["Journal"],"ID":433,"File":"Journal","Pocket":"Unknown","Effect":[{"Effect":"The Journal records limited notes on the player's daily gameplay activities, and can be viewed from the Bag.

On this network, each game has a unique Friend Code, which can be exchanged with others to meet in the Wi-Fi Club. In order for a player to connect with a friend online, they must each register the other in their own Pal Pad. Registering a friend requires knowing their name and Friend Code; however, the name entered does not need to match the friend's actual player character's name. Friends can be registered manually by entering their Friend Codes into the Pal Pad, or automatically by trading Pokémon with other players in the Union Room."},{"Effect":"Besides registering friends, the Pal Pad can be used to list registered friends and read the player's own Friend Code. The player's Friend Code is obtained when connecting to any place in the game having a Wi-Fi compatible activity, such as a Pokémon Center or the Battle Tower for the first time. The Pal Pad also records how many times the player has traded, or how many times the player has won or lost against another player in a Wi-Fi battle. The Pal Pad can register up to 32 friends."}]},"0x01B6":{"Index":"0x01B6","Item":["Works Key"],"ID":438,"File":"Works Key","Pocket":"Unknown","Effect":[{"Effect":"The Works Key allows the player to access unlock the door to the Valley Windworks, allowing them to confront Team Galactic."}]},"0x01B7":{"Index":"0x01B7","Item":["Old Charm"],"ID":439,"File":"Old Charm","Pocket":"Unknown","Effect":[{"Effect":"On their way to Celestic Town, Cynthia gives this Old Charm to the player, and asks them to deliver it her grandmother, the town's elder.
