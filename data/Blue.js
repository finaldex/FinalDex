However, Mimic can't copy Struggle because it is not a normally selectable move."},{"Effect":"The copied move will use Mimic's PP (therefore, Mimic itself loses PP whenever a move copied by Mimic is used). Alternatively, if a Pokémon uses Mimic as a result of Mirror Move or Metronome, then the copied move will use the PP of the move that called it.

If Mimic (as well as Mirror Move or Metronome) has its PP increased by any PP Ups, this unused maximum PP displayed is affected by the PP Ups. For instance, if Mimic copies Tackle, the move and PP can be displayed as \"Tackle 9/35\" (where \"35\" is Tackle's maximum PP, with no PP Ups), or possibly \"Tackle 9/56\" (if three PP Ups have been used on Mimic). However, the true maximum PP usable in battle is Mimic's PP as displayed in the summary screen, not the maximum PP displayed in the list of moves. This is fixed in the Pokémon Stadium series."},{"Effect":"If a Pokémon uses Transform and copies a Pokémon with Mimic (which will have 5 PP, like all moves copied by Transform), and then uses Mimic to copy a Pokémon's move, that copied move will use the PP available from Transform, instead of the Pokémon's own PP."},{"Effect":"If a Pokémon that used Mimic levels up in battle and learns a new move, Mimic's effect is reverted.
