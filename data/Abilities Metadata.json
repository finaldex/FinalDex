Dancer will not activate if the move is stolen by Snatch or if the Pokémon with Dancer is in the semi-invulnerable turn of a move like Fly.\nIf multiple Pokémon have Dancer when a dance move is used, the slowest Pokémon will move first (Lagging Tail and Full Incense are ignored), even during Trick Room.\nIf the Pokémon with Dancer is confused, it may hurt itself instead of copying the move, even if it is protected by a move like Protect or Mat Block. If a Pokémon has flinched, this also applies to moves it subsequently tries to copy with Dancer. A Pokémon with Dancer that is locked into a consecutively executed move (such as Petal Dance) or any move by Encore or a held Choice item will still try to copy the move, but will fail unless it is locked into that same dance move; if a Pokémon uses Petal Dance via Dancer while locked into Petal Dance, this usage does not count towards the 2-3 turn duration. If a Pokémon with Dancer is holding an Assault Vest, it can still successfully copy status dance moves.\nLunar Dance is copied after the original user faints. If a Pokémon copies Petal Dance via Dancer, it will not be locked into the move. If Feather Dance is reflected by Magic Bounce or Magic Coat, Dancer will not activate for either the initial usage of the move or its reflected use. If the Pokémon with Dancer is under the effect of Taunt, it will still try to copy a status dance move, but will fail.\nMoves used via Dancer can be stolen by Snatch and reflected by Magic Bounce and Magic Coat. Moves used via Dancer are not considered the move used most recently (such as for the purpose of Instruct, Mimic or Mirror Move), but damage dealt by them is considered for the purpose of Mirror Coat and Metal Burst.\nIn a Double Battle, if an ally uses a single-target dance move on an opponent, then the copied move will target the same opponent when copied by Dancer.

If a move could hit multiple Pokémon but only hits one due to missing the other Pokémon, it will only strike once.\nSince Parental Bond turns moves into two-hit multi-strike moves, each strike has a separate chance to be a critical hit, items and Abilities that trigger upon strike or contact such as Cursed Body and Rocky Helmet occur for each strike, and Spiky Shield and King's Shield only damage and decrease Attack (respectively) once if they protect a Pokémon from a contact move used by a Pokémon with Parental Bond. Additionally, there is only one accuracy check, so either both strikes hit or both strikes miss.\nAny attack which has a secondary effect (except Secret Power) has the same secondary effect on both strikes (such as Power-Up Punch); if a secondary effect has a certain chance of occurring, each strike has an independent chance of activating that effect. Even if the Pokémon's Ability is changed to Mummy after the first strike, it will continue to make a second strike regardless. Pay Day scatters coins after the first strike only. Incinerate destroys applicable held items after each strike.\nUnlike other secondary effects, Secret Power's secondary effect can only occur after the final strike. If a move has recoil damage, the recoil will be based on the damage dealt by both strikes, but will be taken after the final strike; Struggle will inflict recoil damage equal to half the user's maximum HP (after the final strike). Moves that switch the target out and moves that switch the user out strike twice, then force a Pokémon to switch out after both strikes are conducted. Thief, Covet, Bug Bite, and Pluck do not steal or eat the target's held item until after the final strike, so if the target could use its item after the first strike (e.g. due to low HP), it will use it before the attacker can steal or eat it. Smelling Salts, Wake-Up Slap, and Knock Off do not cure the target's status condition or remove its held item (respectively) until after the final strike, so both strikes get the increased power. Fire-type moves, Scald, and Steam Eruption thaw a frozen target after the final strike (so a frozen target cannot be thawed and then burned by the same move). Smack Down and Thousand Arrows only cause the target to fall to the ground after the final strike. If Meloetta has Parental Bond and uses Relic Song, it will change Forme only once, after the final strike. Burn Up does not remove the user's Fire type until after the second strike (so both strikes receive same-type attack bonus).\nIf Present heals the target it will only strike once, but if it damages the target it will strike twice (the second strike will always damage the target). Fixed-damage moves (such as Seismic Toss and Dragon Rage) deal the full amount of damage for both strikes. The damage dealt by Psywave is generated separately for each strike, and the second strike's damage is not halved. Each strike of Super Fang halves the target's HP (effectively quartering it if HP is not changed between strikes). Counter, Mirror Coat, Metal Burst, and Bide deal the full amount of damage for both strikes. The first strike of Assurance counts as previously taking damage for the second strike, giving it increased power. Fury Cutter and Echoed Voice only consider uses of the move rather than hits, so the second strike's power is not boosted by the first strike.

The damage dealt by Psywave is generated separately for each strike, and the second strike's damage is not halved. Each strike of Super Fang halves the target's HP (effectively quartering it if HP is not changed between strikes). Counter, Mirror Coat, Metal Burst, and Bide deal the full amount of damage for both strikes. The first strike of Assurance counts as previously taking damage for the second strike, giving it increased power. Fury Cutter and Echoed Voice only consider uses of the move rather than hits, so the second strike's power is not boosted by the first strike. Grass Pledge, Fire Pledge, and Water Pledge strike twice, even when used as a combination move. Natural Gift and Spit Up strike twice. Moves that require recharging after use strike twice, but the user only needs to recharge for one turn.\n\nOne-hit knockout moves, Fling, Self-Destruct, Explosion, Final Gambit, Uproar, Rollout, and Ice Ball only strike once. (Other consecutively executed moves, such as Outrage, can strike twice.) Moves with a charging turn (such as Fly and Solar Beam) only strike once, even if the Pokémon becomes fully charged in one turn (such as with a Power Herb).

When using a move that can change type or if the move has been affected by Electrify or Ion Deluge, the type it changes to will be considered.

Furthermore, Anchor Shot, Eerie Spell, Genesis Supernova, Secret Power, Sparkling Aria, and Spirit Shackle are explicitly considered to have added effects that can be removed by Sheer Force. However, Thousand Waves, whose effect is otherwise identical to Anchor Shot and Spirit Shackle, is not.\nSheer Force does not consider recoil or decreasing the user's own stats to be additional effects. Properties of moves—such as having a high critical-hit ratio, being unable to miss, having variable power or powering up, or having a charging turn, among others—are not considered additional effects. Moves that have one of these properties in addition to an additional effect will be powered up and only the additional effect will be negated. For example, Flare Blitz inflicts recoil damage to the user, but also has an additional effect to burn; if the user has Sheer Force, Flare Blitz's damage will be boosted by 30% and the user will take recoil damage, but it cannot burn the target. Effects of Fling caused by holding specific items are not considered additional effects for the purposes of Sheer Force.\nIf (and only if) a move is boosted by the effect of Sheer Force, several effects that normally happen after attacking will be skipped. This includes the effects of Eject Button, Red Card, Shell Bell, Kee Berry, and Maranga Berry; the recoil damage from Life Orb; the Abilities Color Change, Pickpocket, Wimp Out, Emergency Exit, and Berserk; as well as Meloetta's opportunity to switch forms if it acquires Sheer Force and uses Relic Song. Other effects are not negated this way; therefore, if a Pokémon with Sheer Force holding a Life Orb uses a move boosted by Sheer Force, it will gain the passive damage boost (because it isn't a secondary effect of the move nor is it on the list of skipped effects), but the Pokémon will not be damaged by the Life Orb.\nSheer Force does not affect Max Moves, neither powering them up nor removing their secondary effects."},{"Name":"Shell Armor","In Battle":"Shell Armor prevents Pokémon from receiving a critical hit, even if they would usually always land one such as with Frost Breath, Storm Throw, Wicked Blow, Surging Strikes, or with Merciless (if the target is poisoned).","Generation III":"Shell Armor prevents Pokémon from receiving a critical hit.","Generation IV":"Shell Armor prevents Pokémon from receiving a critical hit.","Generation V":"Shell Armor prevents Pokémon from receiving a critical hit, even if they would usually always land one such as with Frost Breath, or Storm Throw.","Generation VI":"Shell Armor prevents Pokémon from receiving a critical hit, even if they would usually always land one such as with Frost Breath, or Storm Throw.","Generation VII":"Shell Armor prevents Pokémon from receiving a critical hit, even if they would usually always land one such as with Frost Breath, Storm Throw, or with Merciless (if the target is poisoned).","Generation VIII":"Shell Armor prevents Pokémon from receiving a critical hit, even if they would usually always land one such as with Frost Breath, Storm Throw, Wicked Blow, Surging Strikes, or with Merciless (if the target is poisoned)."},{"Name":"Shield Dust","In Battle":"Pokémon with Shield Dust are unaffected by the additional effects of damaging moves, including additional effects provided by Poison Touch, Stench, or King's Rock.\nFor example, a Pokémon with Shield Dust cannot be frozen by Blizzard or made to flinch by Fake Out.\nShield Dust has no effect on status moves, such as Thunder Wave or Leech Seed, or on moves that force the target to switch out, such as Dragon Tail.\nUnlike Sheer Force, Shield Dust does not remove additional effects applied to the move's user, such as stat increases or HP draining."},{"Name":"Shields Down","In Battle":"At the start of battle or at the end of a turn, if Minior's HP is above half, it will change into its Meteor Form.

This includes attacks with multiple targets (such as Discharge), as well as attacks exclusively targeting an ally with Telepathy (such as Thunderbolt). However, it is not protected from its allies' status moves (such as Teeter Dance or Confuse Ray).\nWhen Telepathy prevents an attack from hitting, the message \"<name> avoids attacks by its ally Pokémon!\" will be displayed."},{"Name":"Teravolt","In Battle":"Teravolt ignores the effects of Abilities that could potentially affect the damage or effects of a move that its user executes. For example, a Pokémon with Teravolt can hit opponents that possess Levitate by using Earthquake. Teravolt applies regardless of target Pokémon, but only to moves executed by its user (so if two Pokémon in a Double Battle both know Earthquake, only the Pokémon with Teravolt can hit a Pokémon with Levitate).\nTeravolt ignores all ignorable Abilities, not only the targets'—including the user's allies'. For example, if a Pokémon with Teravolt uses Spore on a Pokémon whose ally has Sweet Veil, the target will still fall asleep. Likewise, if a Pokémon with Teravolt uses Thunderbolt targeting an opponent while its own ally has Lightning Rod, it will still use the move on its original target. This also means that a Pokémon with Teravolt will not gain Attack due to an ally's Flower Gift.\nThe Abilities are only ignored while the move is being executed. They take effect again immediately after its execution.\nAbilities that prevent status conditions (such as Immunity and Oblivious) will not protect the Pokémon from receiving the status condition. However, many of these Abilities also have effects to cure the Pokémon of the status condition if afflicted, which will activate immediately after being inflicted with the status condition, even if it was inflicted by a Pokémon with Teravolt.\nIf a Pokémon with Own Tempo consumes a held Berry that may cause confusion in response to the move of a Pokémon with Teravolt, it will become confused if it dislikes the flavor. However, Own Tempo will then activate and cure it of confusion.\nIf a Pokémon with Teravolt forces a Pokémon to switch in by using a move that switches the target out (such as Roar or Dragon Tail), ignorable Abilities are ignored when applying entry hazards. For example, a Pokémon with Levitate switched in this way will be affected by Spikes and Toxic Spikes (unless it is also ungrounded for other reasons); if a Poison-type Pokémon with Levitate is switched in this way, it will remove Toxic Spikes from its side of the field (unless it is also ungrounded for other reasons).\nWhen a Pokémon with Teravolt is brought out, the message \"<name> is radiating a bursting aura!\" will be displayed."},{"Name":"Thick Fat","In Battle":"If a Pokémon with Thick Fat is attacked by an Ice- or Fire-type move, the opponent's Attack or Special Attack is reduced by 50% during damage calculation, effectively halving the damage the Pokémon takes.","Generation III":"If a Pokémon with Thick Fat is attacked by an Ice- or Fire-type move, the opponent's Attack or Special Attack is reduced by 50% during damage calculation, effectively halving the damage the Pokémon takes.","Generation IV":"If a Pokémon with Thick Fat is attacked by an Ice- or Fire-type move, the opponent's Attack or Special Attack is reduced by 50% during damage calculation, effectively halving the damage the Pokémon takes.","Generation V":"If a Pokémon with Thick Fat is attacked by an Ice- or Fire-type move, the opponent's Attack or Special Attack is reduced by 50% during damage calculation, effectively halving the damage the Pokémon takes.","Generation VI":"If a Pokémon with Thick Fat is attacked by an Ice- or Fire-type move, the opponent's Attack or Special Attack is reduced by 50% during damage calculation, effectively halving the damage the Pokémon takes.","Generation VII":"If a Pokémon with Thick Fat is attacked by an Ice- or Fire-type move, the opponent's Attack or Special Attack is reduced by 50% during damage calculation, effectively halving the damage the Pokémon takes.","Generation VIII":"If a Pokémon with Thick Fat is attacked by an Ice- or Fire-type move, the opponent's Attack or Special Attack is reduced by 50% during damage calculation, effectively halving the damage the Pokémon takes."},{"Name":"Tinted Lens","In Battle":"Tinted Lens doubles the damage done by any moves that the Pokémon uses which are \"not very effective\".
