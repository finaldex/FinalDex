Using a move through Dancer is a separate action to using the move originally selected. Dancer will not activate for a move copied by another Pokémon with Dancer, but it will activate on an instructed dance move.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Dancer","Description":"Dancer is able to copy a status dance move that has been powered up into its corresponding Z-Move (e.g. Z-Feather Dance), but the Pokémon with Dancer copies the regular version of the move and does not gain the additional Z-Power effect.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Dancer","Description":"Dancer will not activate if the move's animation does not play (assuming battle animations are on): if all of the move's targets are protected from it, the move fails to affect any Pokémon (e.g. Teeter Dance if all of the targets are already confused or have Own Tempo), or all targets are immune (e.g. Electric-type Revelation Dance if the target is Ground-type). Dancer will not activate if the move is stolen by Snatch or if the Pokémon with Dancer is in the semi-invulnerable turn of a move like Fly.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Dancer","Description":"If multiple Pokémon have Dancer when a dance move is used, the slowest Pokémon will move first (Lagging Tail and Full Incense are ignored), even during Trick Room.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Dancer","Description":"If the Pokémon with Dancer is confused, it may hurt itself instead of copying the move, even if it is protected by a move like Protect or Mat Block. If a Pokémon has flinched, this also applies to moves it subsequently tries to copy with Dancer. A Pokémon with Dancer that is locked into a consecutively executed move (such as Petal Dance) or any move by Encore or a held Choice item will still try to copy the move, but will fail unless it is locked into that same dance move; if a Pokémon uses Petal Dance via Dancer while locked into Petal Dance, this usage does not count towards the 2-3 turn duration. If a Pokémon with Dancer is holding an Assault Vest, it can still successfully copy status dance moves.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Dancer","Description":"Lunar Dance is copied after the original user faints. If a Pokémon copies Petal Dance via Dancer, it will not be locked into the move. If Feather Dance is reflected by Magic Bounce or Magic Coat, Dancer will not activate for either the initial usage of the move or its reflected use. If the Pokémon with Dancer is under the effect of Taunt, it will still try to copy a status dance move, but will fail.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Dancer","Description":"Moves used via Dancer can be stolen by Snatch and reflected by Magic Bounce and Magic Coat. Moves used via Dancer are not considered the move used most recently (such as for the purpose of Instruct, Mimic or Mirror Move), but damage dealt by them is considered for the purpose of Mirror Coat and Metal Burst.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Dancer","Description":"In a Double Battle, if an ally uses a single-target dance move on an opponent, then the copied move will target the same opponent when copied by Dancer. Otherwise, a copied single-target dance move will target the user of the dance move.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Dark Aura","Description":"Dark Aura increases the damage dealt by Dark-type attacks by 33% for all Pokémon on the field. This effect is inverted by Aura Break, instead dividing the power of Dark-type attacks by 1.33, resulting in approximately a 25% reduction in damage.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Dark Aura","Description":"The effects will not stack multiple times if more than one Pokémon has this Ability.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Dauntless Shield","Description":"Dauntless Shield raises the Defense stat of the Pokémon with this Ability by one stage when it enters the battle.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Dazzling","Description":"If an opponent uses a priority move (including moves boosted by Prankster, Gale Wings, or Triage) that targets the Pokémon with Dazzling or its allies, Dazzling prevents the Pokémon from executing that move (PP is still consumed).

Dazzling has no effect on allies' priority moves.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Dazzling","Description":"Priority status Z-Moves will have their Z-Power effect activate. For example, if a Pokémon uses Z-Baby-Doll Eyes on a Pokémon under the effect of Dazzling, the user will still gain Defense, but it will not lower the target's Attack.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Dazzling","Description":"Mold Breaker will ignore this Ability.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Defeatist","Description":"Defeatist halves the user's Attack and Special Attack stats when their HP is equal to or less than half of its maximum.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Defiant","Description":"When a stat of a Pokémon with this Ability is lowered by an opponent, its Attack is increased by two stages.

If the Pokémon no longer has any negative stat stages after Defiant is applied, the White Herb will not have the chance to activate.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Delta Stream","Description":"When a Pokémon with Delta Stream enters the battle or a Pokémon gains the Ability, a unique weather condition called strong winds is created. In a Rotation Battle, Delta Stream will not activate if the Pokémon is sent out in a rotated-out position, nor will it activate when that Pokémon is rotated in. In addition, Delta Stream will not activate if strong winds are already present on the battlefield or if the Pokémon's Ability is suppressed prior to it gaining Delta Stream.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Delta Stream","Description":"Strong winds cause moves that would be super effective against pure Flying-type Pokémon to instead deal neutral damage to all Flying-type Pokémon (unless a Pokémon on the field has Cloud Nine or Air Lock). Outside of Inverse Battles, this causes Electric-, Ice-, and Rock-type moves to deal neutral damage to Flying-type Pokémon; during Inverse Battles, this causes Bug-, Fighting-, Grass-, and Ground-type moves to deal neutral damage to Flying-type Pokémon. If a move is not super effective against the Pokémon's other type (for dual-typed Pokémon), this no longer counts as a super-effective hit (for the purposes of damage-reducing Berries, etc.). Strong winds have no effect on Stealth Rock or Anticipation.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Delta Stream","Description":"Additionally, strong winds cause the weather-modifying moves Sunny Day, Rain Dance, Sandstorm, and Hail to fail if used, and cause the Abilities Drought, Drizzle, Sand Stream, and Snow Warning to fail to activate. However, the strong winds can be replaced by Desolate Land or Primordial Sea.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Delta Stream","Description":"Once strong winds are in effect, as long as there is an active Pokémon on the field with Delta Stream (even if it is not the Pokémon who created it), the strong winds will remain in effect, unless Delta Stream is suppressed or replaced. If the only Pokémon on the field with Delta Stream is rotated out or switched out, or has its Ability suppressed or replaced, the strong winds will dissipate.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Desolate Land","Description":"When a Pokémon with Desolate Land enters the battle or a Pokémon gains the Ability Desolate Land, the Ability creates extremely harsh sunlight, a unique variation of harsh sunlight. In a Rotation Battle, Desolate Land will not activate if the Pokémon is sent out in a rotated-out position, nor will it activate if the Pokémon is rotated in. In addition, Desolate Land will not activate if extremely harsh sunlight is already present on the battlefield.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Desolate Land","Description":"Along with the usual effects of harsh sunlight, extremely harsh sunlight causes damage-dealing Water-type moves to fail (unless a Pokémon on the field has the Air Lock or Cloud Nine Ability). Additionally, extremely harsh sunlight causes the weather-modifying moves Sunny Day, Rain Dance, Sandstorm, and Hail to fail if used; and causes the Abilities Drought, Drizzle, Sand Stream, and Snow Warning to fail to activate.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Desolate Land","Description":"Once in effect, as long as there is a Pokémon on the field with the Ability Desolate Land active (even if it is not the Pokémon who created it), the harsh sunlight will remain in effect unless it is replaced. (If the only Pokémon on the field with Desolate Land is rotated out or switched out, or has its Ability suppressed or replaced, the harsh sunlight will dissipate.) The harsh sunlight can be replaced by Primordial Sea or Delta Stream.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Disguise","Description":"If a Mimikyu in its Disguised Form is hit by a damaging attack or hits itself in confusion, Disguise prevents the move from calling the damage formula. The move will thus deal no damage, and type effectiveness will not be calculated (except in case of immunity, which prevents Disguise from triggering since the move will not hit in the first place). When this effect activates, the message, Its disguise served it as a decoy! is displayed, Mimikyu changes to its Busted Form, and finally the message, <Name>'s disguise was busted! is displayed. If Mimikyu's type had been changed beforehand, it is restored to Ghost/Fairy when it changes to its Busted Form.","Game":"Sun,Moon,Ultra Sun,Ultra Moon"},{"Ability":"Disguise","Description":"Mimikyu remains in Busted Form if it is switched out, but reverts to Disguised Form outside of battle. If a Mimikyu faints and is revived, it will be revived in its Disguised Form and Disguise will be able to activate again.","Game":"Sun,Moon,Ultra Sun,Ultra Moon"},{"Ability":"Disguise","Description":"Disguise will not protect against entry hazards or weather damage. Disguise activates at the first strike of a multi-strike move such as Water Shuriken and will not block damage from remaining strikes. Disguise only blocks the damage from moves; additional effects of damaging moves like paralysis from Nuzzle are not prevented. If Mimikyu has a substitute, the substitute will take damage before Disguise.","Game":"Sun,Moon,Ultra Sun,Ultra Moon"},{"Ability":"Disguise","Description":"Because a Disguise-busting hit skips the type effectiveness check as well as the rest of the damage formula, Weakness Policy will not activate regardless of the move's type. A held Air Balloon will be popped even if Disguise negates the damage. Busting a Disguise with Rollout or Ice Ball results in the Rollout storage glitch.","Game":"Sun,Moon,Ultra Sun,Ultra Moon"},{"Ability":"Disguise","Description":"Gastro Acid, Worry Seed, and Simple Beam fail if the target has the Ability Disguise. Role Play, Skill Swap, and Entrainment fail if either Pokémon has Disguise. Disguise cannot be copied by Trace, Power of Alchemy, or Receiver. Disguise cannot be replaced by Mummy or suppressed by Core Enforcer; if a Pokémon that has its Ability suppressed passes that effect to a Pokémon with this Ability via Baton Pass, that effect fades. If a Pokémon obtains Disguise with Imposter or Transform, the Ability will never activate.","Game":"Sun,Moon,Ultra Sun,Ultra Moon"},{"Ability":"Disguise","Description":"Pokémon with Mold Breaker, Teravolt or Turboblaze will ignore Disguise, hitting through the disguise without busting it. The same is true for the moves Moongeist Beam, Sunsteel Strike, and Photon Geyser as well as the Z-Moves Searing Sunraze Smash, Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom, and Light That Burns the Sky.","Game":"Sun,Moon,Ultra Sun,Ultra Moon"},{"Ability":"Disguise","Description":"When a Disguised Form Mimikyu's Disguise is busted, upon changing to its Busted Form it now loses HP equal to 1/8 of its maximum HP, rounded down, and not factoring in any increase in maximum HP due to Dynamax. The moves G-Max Drum Solo, G-Max Fireball, and G-Max Hydrosnipe will ignore Disguise.","Game":"Sword,Shield,Brilliant Diamond,Shining Pearl,Legend Arceus"},{"Ability":"Download","Description":"Download raises either the Attack stat or Special Attack stat by one stage depending on the foe's lowest current defensive stat: it will raise Attack if the foe's current Defense is lower than its current Special Defense stat, otherwise it will raise Special Attack.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Download","Description":"For determining which of the foe's defensive stat is lower, Download takes into account stat stages and the effect of Power Trick; however, it does not consider the effects of held items, Abilities such as Marvel Scale, or Wonder Room. In case of a tie between the foe's Defense and Special Defense, Download increases Special Attack.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Download","Description":"During a Double or Triple Battle, Download will calculate the average Defense and Special Defense by adding the stats of all opposing Pokémon, and determine the lowest stat between both averages.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Dragon's Maw","Description":"Dragon's Maw boosts the power of user's Dragon-type moves by 50%.","Game":"All"},{"Ability":"Drizzle","Description":"Drizzle summons rain in battle as soon as a Pokémon with Drizzle enters the battle.

It does not affect multi-strike moves.","Game":"X,Y,Omega Ruby,Alpha Sapphire"},{"Ability":"Parental Bond","Description":"If a move could hit multiple targets (including allies), such as Earthquake and Rock Slide, it will not strike twice; however, if it can only hit a single Pokémon, such as in a Single Battle or if using a move that can hit multiple targets when only one target is in range, it will strike twice. If a move could hit multiple Pokémon but only hits one due to missing the other Pokémon, it will only strike once.","Game":"X,Y,Omega Ruby,Alpha Sapphire"},{"Ability":"Parental Bond","Description":"Since Parental Bond turns moves into two-hit multi-strike moves, each strike has a separate chance to be a critical hit, items and Abilities that trigger upon strike or contact such as Cursed Body and Rocky Helmet occur for each strike, and Spiky Shield and King's Shield only damage and decrease Attack (respectively) once if they protect a Pokémon from a contact move used by a Pokémon with Parental Bond. Additionally, there is only one accuracy check, so either both strikes hit or both strikes miss.","Game":"X,Y,Omega Ruby,Alpha Sapphire"},{"Ability":"Parental Bond","Description":"Any attack which has a secondary effect (except Secret Power) has the same secondary effect on both strikes (such as Power-Up Punch); if a secondary effect has a certain chance of occurring, each strike has an independent chance of activating that effect.

If a move has recoil damage, the recoil will be based on the damage dealt by both strikes, but will be taken after the final strike; Struggle will inflict recoil damage equal to half the user's maximum HP (after the final strike). Moves that switch the target out and moves that switch the user out strike twice, then force a Pokémon to switch out after both strikes are conducted. Thief, Covet, Bug Bite, and Pluck do not steal or eat the target's held item until after the final strike, so if the target could use its item after the first strike (e.g. due to low HP), it will use it before the attacker can steal or eat it. Smelling Salts, Wake-Up Slap, and Knock Off do not cure the target's status condition or remove its held item (respectively) until after the final strike, so both strikes get the increased power. Fire-type moves, Scald, and Steam Eruption thaw a frozen target after the final strike (so a frozen target cannot be thawed and then burned by the same move). Smack Down and Thousand Arrows only cause the target to fall to the ground after the final strike. If Meloetta has Parental Bond and uses Relic Song, it will change Forme only once, after the final strike. Burn Up does not remove the user's Fire type until after the second strike (so both strikes receive same-type attack bonus).","Game":"X,Y,Omega Ruby,Alpha Sapphire"},{"Ability":"Parental Bond","Description":"If Present heals the target it will only strike once, but if it damages the target it will strike twice (the second strike will always damage the target). Fixed-damage moves (such as Seismic Toss and Dragon Rage) deal the full amount of damage for both strikes. The damage dealt by Psywave is generated separately for each strike, and the second strike's damage is not halved. Each strike of Super Fang halves the target's HP (effectively quartering it if HP is not changed between strikes). Counter, Mirror Coat, Metal Burst, and Bide deal the full amount of damage for both strikes. The first strike of Assurance counts as previously taking damage for the second strike, giving it increased power. Fury Cutter and Echoed Voice only consider uses of the move rather than hits, so the second strike's power is not boosted by the first strike. Grass Pledge, Fire Pledge, and Water Pledge strike twice, even when used as a combination move. Natural Gift and Spit Up strike twice. Moves that require recharging after use strike twice, but the user only needs to recharge for one turn.","Game":"X,Y,Omega Ruby,Alpha Sapphire"},{"Ability":"Parental Bond","Description":"One-hit knockout moves, Fling, Self-Destruct, Explosion, Final Gambit, Uproar, Rollout, and Ice Ball only strike once.

It also activates after the user consumes a single-use item due to the attack that hit it, such as a Focus Sash. Consequently, the Pokémon that has Pickpocket will always end up with the item.

Moves that have one of these properties in addition to an additional effect will be powered up and only the additional effect will be negated. For example, Flare Blitz inflicts recoil damage to the user, but also has an additional effect to burn; if the user has Sheer Force, Flare Blitz's damage will be boosted by 30% and the user will take recoil damage, but it cannot burn the target.
